# SchemaSnap

**SchemaSnap** is a lightweight CLI tool to snapshot and track changes to database schemas over time.  
It helps developers and database administrators detect schema changes, generate diffs, and manage database evolution with ease.

---

## Features

- üìÑ **Snapshot Schemas:** Quickly save the structure of a database as a file.
- üîç **Diff Snapshots:** Compare two snapshots and highlight added, removed, or modified schema elements.
- üïí **Timestamped Outputs:** Auto-generate snapshot filenames with timestamps.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Simple CLI Usage:** Minimal flags and clear commands.
- üöÄ **Fast and Expandable:** Start with PostgreSQL support, with plans for MySQL, SQLite, and MongoDB.

## Example Usage

Snapshot a database schema:

```bash
schemasnap snapshot postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb --output ./snapshots
```

Diff two snapshots:

```bash
schemasnap diff ./snapshots/2025-04-10.sql ./snapshots/2025-04-17.sql
```

## Installation

_Coming soon._  
Once the first release is available, you will be able to install SchemaSnap easily via prebuilt binaries.

For now, clone and build locally:
